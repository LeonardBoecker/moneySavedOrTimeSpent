# Time vs. Money Evaluation Tool

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate the trade-off between the time spent choosing what to buy versus the time spent purchasing pre-made items. The goal is to determine whether spending time to select items offers better returns in terms of available time for work and potential earnings.

## Objectives

- **Time Evaluation**: Analyze the time spent on decision-making when choosing purchases versus the time spent buying ready-made items.
- **Financial Analysis**: Explore the relationship between time spent and earnings per hour/minute to determine the monetary value of time.
- **Decision Framework**: Provide insights into whether investing time in selecting items leads to better financial outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on the time spent on various purchasing decisions and the corresponding prices of items.
2. **Time-to-Money Conversion**: Calculate how much money could be earned during the time spent making purchasing decisions based on hourly and minute-based rates.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the net benefits of choosing items vs. buying pre-made options, taking into account the time invested and potential earnings.
